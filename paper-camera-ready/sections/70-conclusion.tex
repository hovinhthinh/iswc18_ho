\section{Conclusion}

We presented a method for learning rules that may contain negated atoms from KGs that
dynamically exploits feedback from a precomputed embedding model. 
Our approach is general in that any embedding model can be utilized including text-enhanced ones, which indirectly allows us to 
harness
unstructured 
web sources 
for rule learning.
 We evaluated our approach with various configurations on real-world datasets and observed significant improvements
over state-of-the-art rule learning systems.\looseness=-1

An interesting future direction is to extend our work to more complex non-monotonic rules with higher-arity predicates,
aggregates and existential variables or disjunctions in rule heads, which is challenging due to inevitable scalability issues.
